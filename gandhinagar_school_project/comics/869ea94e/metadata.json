  "story": "Here's a story for a 6-panel comic strip featuring Rohan Patel and Kabir, focusing on Priya:\n\n**Title: The Priya Predicament**\n\n**Panel 1:**\n\n*   **Setting:** School hallway, lockers in the background. Rohan stands nervously, clutching his books, thick glasses slightly askew. Kabir, more relaxed, leans against a locker, grinning.\n*   **Visual:** Exaggerated sweat droplets on Rohan's forehead.\n*   **Dialogue:**\n    *   **Kabir:** (Pointing) \"Dude, chill! You look like you're about to debug a spaceship single-handedly.\"\n    *   **Rohan:** \"Easy for you to say, Kabir. I have to give Priya her math notes back! What if she asks... you know?\"\n\n**Panel 2:**\n\n*   **Setting:** Close up on Rohan's face, eyes wide with anxiety.\n*   **Visual:** Speech bubble filled with swirling question marks and a tiny drawing of a heart.\n*   **Dialogue:** (Rohan's internal monologue) \"Asks *what*? About my feelings? About the weather? About the optimal trajectory for a paper airplane?\"\n\n**Panel 3:**\n\n*   **Setting:** Wider shot, showing Priya approaching, smiling warmly. She's holding a science textbook.\n*   **Visual:** Priya has a small streak of marker on her cheek. Rohan freezes, rigid. Kabir gives him a subtle thumbs-up from behind Priya.\n*   **Dialogue:**\n    *   **Priya:** \"Hey Rohan! Thanks so much for the notes! I totally spaced during Mr. Sharma's lecture.\"\n\n**Panel 4:**\n\n*   **Setting:** Close-up on Rohan, stammering.\n*   **Visual:** Rohan\u2019s glasses are fogged up, one lens slightly popped out of the frame.\n*   **Dialogue:**\n    *   **Rohan:** \"Uh... no problem, Priya! Glad... glad they helped! The... the quadratic equation is... quite\u2026 fascinating.\"\n\n**Panel 5:**\n\n*   **Setting:** Full shot of the trio. Priya laughs, pointing at her cheek. Kabir is trying (and failing) not to laugh.\n*   **Visual:** Priya wiping the marker streak off her cheek. Rohan's uniform is slightly askew, ID card hanging crookedly.\n*   **Dialogue:**\n    *   **Priya:** \"Speaking of fascinating, I got marker all over my face in science class. Did anyone notice?\"\n    *   **Kabir:** (Barely containing laughter) \"Nope! Perfectly\u2026 invisible!\"\n\n**Panel 6:**\n\n*   **Setting:** Rohan and Kabir walking away from Priya. Rohan sighs in relief.\n*   **Visual:** Rohan fixing his glasses, a small smile playing on his lips. Kabir pats him on the back, chuckling.\n*   **Dialogue:**\n    *   **Rohan:** \"That was... easier than expected.\"\n    *   **Kabir:** \"See? Just gotta stay calm! Now, about those paper airplane trajectories...\"\n    *   **Rohan:** \"Actually, I have some ideas involving Bernoulli's principle...\"",
