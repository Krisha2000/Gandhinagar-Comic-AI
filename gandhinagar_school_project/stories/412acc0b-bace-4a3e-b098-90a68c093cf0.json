  "content": "**Title: The Great School Rush**\n\n**Panel 1:**\n\n*   **Setting:** Kabir's bedroom. His alarm clock reads 7:55 AM. (School starts at 8:00 AM). He's sprawled on his bed, deeply asleep, blanket tangled around him.\n*   **Visual:** Sunbeams streaming through the window, dust motes dancing. Exaggerated snoring coming from Kabir.\n*   **Dialogue:** (Sound Effect) *ZZZZZZZZ!*\n\n**Panel 2:**\n\n*   **Setting:** Kabir jolts awake, eyes wide with panic.\n*   **Visual:** Hair even messier than usual. Speech bubble with a clock showing 7:58 AM.\n*   **Dialogue:**\n    *   **Kabir:** \"Aiyyo! School!\"\n\n**Panel 3:**\n\n*   **Setting:** Kabir dashes through his house, grabbing his backpack and shoving a roti into his mouth simultaneously. His mom stands in the doorway, shaking her head with a smile.\n*   **Visual:** Backpack overflowing with books. Roti crumbs flying.\n*   **Dialogue:**\n    *   **Mom:** \"Kabir! Be careful! And chew your food!\"\n    *   **Kabir:** (Mouth full) \"Bye, Amma! Late!\"\n\n**Panel 4:**\n\n*   **Setting:** Kabir sprints down the street, tie flapping in the wind. He trips over his untied shoelace.\n*   **Visual:** Hilariously exaggerated fall, books scattering everywhere. A stray dog looks on with amusement.\n*   **Dialogue:** (Sound Effect) *THUMP!*\n    *   **Kabir:** \"Oof!\"\n\n**Panel 5:**\n\n*   **Setting:** Kabir bursts through the school gates, breathless. He sees Rohan calmly standing near the entrance, adjusting his glasses.\n*   **Visual:** Rohan looks unperturbed, holding a tablet. Kabir is disheveled, shoelace still untied.\n*   **Dialogue:**\n    *   **Kabir:** \"Rohan! What time is it?\"\n    *   **Rohan:** (Looking at his digital watch) \"7:59:50. You have ten seconds.\"\n\n**Panel 6:**\n\n*   **Setting:** Inside the classroom. Kabir slides into his seat just as the bell rings. Mr. Sharma, the teacher, raises an eyebrow.\n*   **Visual:** Kabir grinning sheepishly, covered in leaves. Mr. Sharma has a twinkle in his eye.\n*   **Dialogue:** (Sound Effect) *BRRRRRRIIIIIIING!*\n    *   **Mr. Sharma:** \"Mr. Khan! Glad you could join us. Though, next time, try the door instead of the garden!\"\n    *   **Kabir:** (Smiling) \"Wouldn't miss it, sir!\"",
